## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Firebase Setup

### **Step 1: Deploy Firestore Security Rules**

You need to deploy the security rules to your Firebase project. You have two options:

#### **Option A: Firebase Console (Easiest)**

1. **Go to Firestore Database:**
   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eventpro-deb95/firestore
   ```

2. **Click on "Rules" tab**

3. **Replace the rules with the content from `firestore.rules` file**
   - Copy everything from `/workspaces/event-management/firestore.rules`
   - Paste into the Firebase Console
   - Click "Publish"

#### **Option B: Firebase CLI (Automated)**

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project
cd /workspaces/event-management
firebase init

# When prompted, select:
# - Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes
# - Storage: Deploy rules
# - Use existing project: eventpro-deb95

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only storage:rules
```

---

### **Step 2: Deploy Cloud Storage Security Rules**

1. **Go to Cloud Storage:**
   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eventpro-deb95/storage
   ```

2. **Click on "Rules" tab**

3. **Replace the rules with the content from `storage.rules` file**
   - Copy everything from `/workspaces/event-management/storage.rules`
   - Paste into the Firebase Console
   - Click "Publish"

---

### **Step 3: Enable Firebase Services**

Make sure these services are enabled in Firebase Console:

#### **Authentication:**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eventpro-deb95/authentication
```
- ✅ Enable **Email/Password** authentication
- ✅ Enable **Google** sign-in
- 📧 Support email: `jayborhade2004@gmail.com` (already set)

#### **Firestore Database:**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eventpro-deb95/firestore
```
- ✅ Create database if not exists
- ✅ Choose location (e.g., `us-central1`)
- ✅ Start in **production mode** (our rules are ready!)

#### **Cloud Storage:**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eventpro-deb95/storage
```
- ✅ Enable Cloud Storage
- ✅ Create folders (will be auto-created when files are uploaded):
  - `profile_images/`
  - `event_images/`
  - `event_banners/`
  - `speaker_images/`
  - `sponsor_logos/`
  - `venue_maps/`
  - `session_recordings/`
  - `chat_files/`
  - `qr_codes/`

#### **Cloud Messaging (FCM):**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eventpro-deb95/settings/cloudmessaging
```
- ✅ Already enabled! (automatic with Firebase setup)

### **Step 4: Add SHA-1 Certificate for Google Sign-In**

To enable Google Sign-In, you need to add your SHA-1 certificate:

```bash
# Get SHA-1 from debug keystore
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
  -alias androiddebugkey \
  -storepass android \
  -keypass android | grep SHA1

# Or generate if doesn't exist:
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
  -alias androiddebugkey \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -storepass android \
  -keypass android \
  -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
```

Then add to Firebase:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eventpro-deb95/settings/general
2. Scroll to "Your apps" → "EventPro AI Android"
3. Click "Add fingerprint"
4. Paste your SHA-1 fingerprint
5. Click "Save"

---

### **Step 5: Rebuild Your App**

After configuring Firebase, rebuild your app with the real configuration:

```bash
cd /workspaces/event-management

# Clean previous builds
./gradlew clean

# Build new APK with real Firebase config
./gradlew assembleDebug

# The APK will be at:
# app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```
