# üöÄ Running EventPro AI - Step by Step

## Current Status
Your EventPro AI Android app is **ready to build**, but needs Firebase configuration to run properly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is an Android App

This application **cannot run directly in this dev container** because:
1. It's an Android app (needs Android device/emulator)
2. It requires Android Studio
3. It needs Firebase configuration
4. It requires Google Play Services

## üéØ Two Options to Run This App

### **Option 1: Run on Your Local Machine (Recommended)**

#### Step 1: Prerequisites
```bash
# You need to install:
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK
```

#### Step 2: Clone/Download Project
```bash
# If this is in a cloud environment, download the project:
# You can zip it or use git to push to GitHub first
cd /workspaces/event-management
git add .
git commit -m "Complete EventPro AI project"
git push origin main
```

Then on your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dakshit06/event-management.git
cd event-management
```

#### Step 3: Firebase Setup (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Create a new project: "EventPro AI"
3. Add an Android app with package: `com.eventpro.ai`
4. Download `google-services.json`
5. Place it in `app/` folder
6. Enable these services:
   - Authentication (Email/Password + Google)
   - Firestore Database
   - Storage
   - Cloud Messaging

#### Step 4: Run in Android Studio
```bash
# Open Android Studio
# File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Select event-management folder
# Wait for Gradle sync
# Connect Android device or start emulator
# Click Run (green play button) or Shift+F10
```

### **Option 2: Test Build in Dev Container**

While we can't run the app here, we CAN verify it builds correctly:

```bash
# Check if gradlew exists and make it executable
chmod +x gradlew

# Try to build (will fail without google-services.json, but shows other issues)
./gradlew build --warning-mode all
```

Let me create a mock google-services.json so we can at least test the build:

## üõ†Ô∏è Let's Test the Build Now

I'll create a temporary Firebase config so we can verify the build works:
